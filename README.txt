Behat One Time Login
====================

Authenticates users through the Drupal one time login mechanism in Behat
scenarios.

This is intended for projects that do not use the default Drupal login form but
instead rely on 2-Factor Authentication, Single Sign On or other non-standard
authentication methods.
